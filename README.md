# Java-Calculator
A Java Calculator I built in order to practice and improve my understanding of Java software development



Here's the blueprint I made while working on this program. Outlining all the features that I want in a program is very important for developing software properly:

/**
 * ------------------
 * | GUI Calculator |
 * ------------------
 * [] Front side deals with graphics 
 * [] Back side deals with calculations
 * 
 * ----steps----
 * [X] 1. I need to setup the calculations
 * [] 2. Make functional program without GUI
 * 		[X] a. Add choice when to exit (loop otherwise)
 * 		[X] b. Deal with zero division
 * 		[] c. Be able to instantiate variables (setters, getters for vars)
 * [] 3. Then setup GUI
 * -------------------------
 * | Types of Calculations |
 * -------------------------
 * [X] Addition, Subtractions, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Exponent, Exponent 2, 
 * [] variables (set | reset| multiple variables no limit?)
 * -----------------------
 * | Other functionality |
 * -----------------------
 * [X] able to do 1 calculation after another
 * [] Compound calculations
 * [] exit button
 * [] Duplicate calculator? (opt.)
 *
